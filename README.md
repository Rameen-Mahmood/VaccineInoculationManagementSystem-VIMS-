###### Vaccine Inoculation Management System (VIMS)


## Goal
The Vaccine Inoculation Management System (VIMS) would potentially be able to streamline the entire process of checking for vaccine availability in a certain region they belong to, see if theyâ€™re eligible, refer to vaccination schedules and register themself for their preferred choice of vaccine. In sum, it would significantly ease the process of individuals being able to get vaccinate themselves against Covid-19.
