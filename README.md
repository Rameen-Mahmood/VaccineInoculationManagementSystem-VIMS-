###### Vaccine Inoculation Management System (VIMS)


_Problem Statement_

My project aims to streamline the vaccination process for individuals where it is difficult to impossible to register for a vaccine. The inspiration for my project is based on the situation in my home country Pakistan, where there is little to no organization of vaccine administration. There are not only multiple delays in the system, but without an online healthcare system, there is no database of user registration, which results in overcrowding in vaccination drives which results in spikes of Covid-19. My project is a step in order to tackle this problem. 

**_Abstract_**

The Vaccine Inoculation Management System (VIMS) is a software to allow users to fast-track their vaccination in the region they belong to. In this platform, they are able to check the available vaccinations in their region and confirm their eligibility. If they are eligible, they are able to register themselves for the vaccines and book an appointment based on the available times. They are also able to login to the portal and view their vaccination status, and login details. This model can be implemented to streamline the vaccination process for individuals in almost every country in the world, and eliminates the need for in person vaccine registration and appointment booking. 

**Approach**

My project enables the user to have a certain degree of control in their vaccination procedures. It provides an interface for users to easily inoculate themselves against Covid-19 and its variants in a simple, efficient manner. My project implements several object oriented programming concepts in order to make the code modular, clean and reduce compilation time. 

My project offers the following functionalities:

1) The software displays a list of all the available vaccines in a region (which the user specifies). 
2) Through a series of pre-screening questions, the software checks whether the user is eligible for the vaccine or not. 
3) If eligible, the user can register for the vaccine and enter their details in the system. 
4) Once registered, the user is able to choose a preferred date and time based on the existing vaccination appointment schedule, and book a time to get vaccinated. 
5) If the user wants to see the status of their application — their login details, vaccination status, or appointment time, they may login with their previously set username and password and view their registration information. 

**Guidelines for use:**

- For selection 1, please make sure to enter the name of the region correctly —to find the list of country names in the csv file, you may download it from here. 
- For selection 4, before running the code, make sure that there is no end of file character / newline character in the appointments.csv file. The original copy of the file is within the project file for reference — it is labeled as “appointments (copy).csv”
